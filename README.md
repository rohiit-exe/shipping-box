##  Usage

1.  **Add Box:** Navigate to the **"Add Box"** tab (or `/form`). Enter the receiver's name, weight, choose a color, and select a country. Submitting the form will add the box to the global state.
2.  **View Boxes:** Navigate to the **"View Boxes"** tab (or `/list`). You will see a table listing all the added boxes, along with the calculated shipping cost for each item.
